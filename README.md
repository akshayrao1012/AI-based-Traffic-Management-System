## Abstract

In this fast-paced world where everything is powered with technologies like AI, some systems were automated but never really were included in the AI space. One such example is that of the traditional traffic management system. Since childhood we have seen the same traffic signal that works at a set time by the traffic authorities. Nothing much has changed since the invention of these signals. While all the appliances and machines are now powered using AI, the traffic system still runs in the traditional way. This led us to explore the idea of building a smart traffic management system, where the idea is simple but the impact is tremendous. According to one of the posts, an average citizen wastes around 20-25% of time waiting at a signal in the US. This number would be quite high in countries like India, considering narrow roads and a substantially heavy number of vehicles. Even though the number looks small but 
when multiplied with the number of commuters, this problem is worth addressing even if the number is reduced by even a small ratio. 

Currently we have CCTV cameras available at most of the highway signals. With the growing trend of 5G and IoT, we can expect an increase in more sensors along with CCTV images that can combine to provide additional traffic information / dataset about traffic density, which can answer the peak hours, accidents, traffic slowdown issues etc, types of vehicles, frequent defaulters etc.

## Problem Definition

Our focus would be on vehicle detection within a defined boundary, classifying them into small, medium and large vehicle categories. Further extending it, we would be focusing to determine/predict the vehicle counts and quantify the traffic conditions that can help traffic management systems. Example - optimise the traffic light duration with respect to the number of vehicles.
In this project, we have focused on using advanced computer vision methods that shall use Real-Time image/video processing and extract valuable features and information. 
We look forward to reducing the traffic duration by identifying the number of vehicles. This system not only solves the traffic issue but also the data retrieved from this system will be used to monitor and manage traffic more efficiently.
